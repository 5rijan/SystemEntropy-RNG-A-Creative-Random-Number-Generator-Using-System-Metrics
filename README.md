# SystemEntropy-RNG

SystemEntropy-RNG is a random number generator that leverages system metrics, such as CPU usage and memory usage, to introduce entropy into the generation process. This project explores a creative approach to generating random-like values using unconventional sources.

## Features

- Utilizes system metrics to add entropy to the random number generation.
- Provides a unique and experimental perspective on random number generation.
- Cross-platform support for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/5rijan/SystemEntropy-RNG.git
    cd SystemEntropy-RNG
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python random_generator.py
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input lower and upper bounds for the generated random number.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x

## Supported Platforms

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS

## Limitations

- The randomness quality may not be suitable for cryptographic or high-stakes applications.
- Precision issues may arise due to the conversion of hashed values to floats.

## Contributing

If you find issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.


## Acknowledgments

- The inspiration for this project comes from the curiosity of exploring unconventional sources of entropy for random number generation.
